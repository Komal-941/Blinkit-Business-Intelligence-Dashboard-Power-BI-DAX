### Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Blinkit's sales performance, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution using Power BI. 
The interactive dashboard provides valuable insights into sales trends, outlet performance, and product category analysis to help businesses optimize decision-making.
### Objective:
The goal of this project is to conduct a detailed analysis of Blinkit‚Äôs sales data to identify trends, improve customer experience, and optimize inventory distribution.
- **Key Business Problems Addressed:**
   - Identify high-performing outlet types, locations, and item categories.
   - Assess how fat content impacts sales trends.
   - Understand how outlet size and establishment year influence revenue.
   - Optimize inventory distribution for better customer satisfaction.

### Dataset Information
 - Source: Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arunkumaroraon/blinkit-grocery-dataset)
-  Number of Outlets: 3 (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3)
-  Key Columns in the Dataset:
     - Item Details: Fat Content, Item Identifier, Item Type, Item Visibility, Item Weight
     - Outlet Information: Outlet Identifier, Outlet Type, Outlet Size, Outlet Location Type, Outlet Establishment Year

###  Tools & Technologies Used
- Power BI ‚Äì Dashboard development & data visualization
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) ‚Äì Created custom KPIs & calculations
